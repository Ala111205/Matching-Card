# 🧠 Matching-Card

A responsive web-based memory game built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
Flip cards to find matching pairs. Track your **moves**, **time**, and **score**.  
Includes two difficulty levels (**4×4 Easy** and **6×6 Hard**) and a **congratulations modal** when you win.

## 🎮 How to Play
1. Click a card to flip it.
2. Click another card:
   - ✅ If they match → both stay face up.
   - ❌ If not → they flip back after a short delay.
3. Continue until all pairs are matched.
4. A **Congratulations** message will appear showing your moves, time, and score.
